                3.2. Creation of an Account<br/>
                <br/>
                The Platform enables Members to post and view Adverts and to interact with each other to book a Seat. You cannot view the Adverts if you are not registered on the Platform. You cannot post an Advert or book a Seat without having first created an Account and become a Member.<br/>
                <br/>
                To create your Account, you can:<br/>
                <br/>
                (i) either complete all mandatory fields on the registration form;<br/>
                <br/>
                (ii) or log in to your Facebook account via our Platform (hereinafter referred to as your “Facebook Account”). In using such functionality, you understand that Taggcar will have access to, will publish on the Platform, and will keep certain information from your Facebook Account. You can delete the link between your Account and your Facebook Account at any time through the “Verifications” section of your profile. If you wish to find out more about the use of your data from your Facebook Account, read our Privacy Policy and that of Facebook.<br/>
                <br/>
                To register on the Platform, you must have read and accepted these T&Cs and the Privacy Policy.
                When creating your Account, regardless of the method chosen, you agree to provide accurate and true information, and to update it through your profile or by notifying Taggcar, in order to guarantee its relevance and accuracy throughout your contractual relations with Taggcar.<br/>
                <br/>
                In the case of registration by email, you agree to keep secret the password chosen upon creating your Account and not to communicate it to anybody. If you lose or disclose your password, you undertake to inform Taggcar immediately. You alone are responsible for the use of your Account by third parties, unless you have expressly notified Taggcar of the loss, the fraudulent use by a third party, or the disclosure of your password to a third party.<br/>
                <br/>
                You agree not to create or use, under your own identity or that of a third party, Accounts other than that initially created.<br/>

                <br/>
                Taggcar may, for the purposes of transparency, improving trust, or prevention or detection of fraud, set up a system for verification of some of the information you provide on your profile. This is notably the case when you enter your telephone number or provide us with an Identity document.<br/>
                <br/>
                You recognize and accept that any reference on the Platform or the Services to “verified” information, or any similar term, means only that a Member has successfully passed the verification procedure existing on the Platform or the Services in order to provide you with more information about the Member with whom you are considering travelling. Taggcar cannot guarantee the truthfulness, reliability or validity of the information subject of the verification procedure.<br/>
                <br/>
                4. Use of the Services<br/>
                <br/>
                4.1. Posting Adverts<br/>

                <br/>
                When posting your Advert, you can indicate the milestone cities in which you agree to stop, to pick up or drop off Passengers. The sections of the Trip between these milestone cities or between one of these milestone towns and the collection point or destination of the Trip constitute “Legs”.<br/>
                <br/>
                You are only authorized to post an Advert if you fulfil all the following conditions:<br/>
                <br/>
                (i) you hold a valid driving license;<br/>
                <br/>
                (ii) you only offer Adverts for vehicles you own or use with the express permission of the owner, and in all cases that you are authorized to use for the purposes of carpooling;<br/>
                <br/>
                (iii) you are and remain the main driver of the vehicle subject of the Advert;<br/>
                <br/>
                (iv) the vehicle has valid third party insurance;<br/>
                <br/>
                (v) you have no contraindication or medical incapacity for driving;<br/>
                <br/>
                (vi) the vehicle you intend to use for the Trip is a touring car with 4 wheels and a maximum of 5 seats;<br/>
                <br/>
                (vii) you do not intend posting another advert for the same Trip on the Platform;<br/>
                <br/>
                (viii) you do not offer more Seats than the number available in your vehicle;<br/>
                <br/>
                (ix) all Seats offered have a seatbelt, even if the vehicle is approved with seats having no seatbelt;<br/>

                (x) to use a vehicle in good working order and which complies with the applicable legal provisions and customs, notably with an up-to-date Vehicle Inspection.<br/>
                <br/>
                You recognize that you are solely responsible for the content of the Advert you post on the Platform. Consequently, you represent and warrant the accuracy and truthfulness of all information contained in your Advert, and you undertake to fulfil the Trip under the conditions described in your Advert.<br/>
                <br/>
                Providing your Advert complies with the T&Cs, it will be posted on the Platform and therefore visible to Members and all visitors, even non-members, conducting a search on the Platform or on the website of Taggcar’s partners. Taggcar reserves the right, at its sole discretion and without notice, to not post or to remove, at any time, any Advert that does not comply with the T&Cs or that it considers as damaging to its image, that of the Platform, or that of the Services.<br/>
                <br/>
                You recognize and accept that the criteria taken into account in the classification and the order of display of your Advert among the other Adverts are at the sole discretion of Taggcar.<br/>
                <br/>
                4.2.    Booking a Seat<br/>
                <br/>
                The methods of booking of a Seat depend on the nature of the Trip envisaged. For some Trips, Taggcar has set up an online booking system.<br/>
                <br/>
                4.2.1.    Trip with Booking<br/>
                <br/>
                Taggcar has set up a system for booking Seats online (“Booking”) for some Trips offered on the Platform (“Trips with Booking”).<br/>
                <br/>
                Eligibility of a Trip for the Booking system remains at the sole discretion of Taggcar, which reserves the right to modify these conditions at any time.<br/>
                <br/>
                When a Passenger is interested in an Advert benefiting from Booking, he may make an online Booking request. This Booking request is either (i) accepted automatically (if the Driver chose this option when posting his Advert), or (ii) accepted manually by the Driver. At the time of the Booking, the Passenger makes online payment of the Cost Contribution and the related Service Fees, where applicable. After receipt of the payment by Taggcar and validation of the Booking request by the Driver, where applicable, the Passenger receives a Booking Confirmation (the “Booking Confirmation”).<br/>
                <br/>
                If you are a Driver and have chosen to handle manually the Bookings requests when posting your Advert, you are required to respond to any Booking request within the timeframe specified by the Passenger during the Booking request. Otherwise, the Booking request will expire automatically and the Passenger shall be refunded all sums paid at the time of the Booking request, if any.<br/>
                <br/>
                At the time of the Booking Confirmation, Taggcar will send you the telephone number of the Driver (if you are the Passenger) or of the Passenger (if you are the Driver). You are then solely responsible for executing the contract binding you to the other Member. This service will not be available in the beta version of the Taggcar application. <br/>
                <br/>
                4.2.2.    Trip without Booking<br/>
                <br/>
                For journeys not benefiting from the online system for booking Seats (“Trips without Booking”), Taggcar offers a free service (i.e. without Service Fee) enabling the Passenger to send a message to the Driver of a Trip he may be interested in. At the time of sending this message, Taggcar will send you the contact information of the Driver (if you are the Passenger) or of the Passenger (if you are the Driver), if the Member agreed to display his/her phone number. You are then solely responsible for arranging the details of the Trip with the other Member, and you alone assume the risks linked to cancellations, changes of the details of the journey, and non-payment of the Cost Contribution.<br/>
                <br/>
                4.2.3.    Named nature of the Seat booking and terms of use of the Services on behalf of a third party<br/>
                <br/>
                Any use of the Services, in the capacity of Passenger or Driver, relates to a specific name. The Driver and the Passenger must correspond to the identity communicated to Taggcar and the other Members participating in the Trip.<br/>
                <br/>
                However, Taggcar allows its Members to book one or more Seats on behalf of a third party. In this case, you undertake to accurately indicate to the Driver, at the time of the Booking or when sending the message to the Driver (in the context of a Trip without Booking), the forenames, age and telephone number of the person on whose behalf you are reserving a Seat. It is strictly prohibited to book a Seat for a minor under the age of 13 travelling alone. In the case where you are reserving a seat for a minor over the age of 13 travelling alone, you undertake to request the prior agreement of the Driver and to provide him with duly completed and signed permission of his/her legal representatives.<br/>
                <br/>
                In addition, the Platform is intended for the booking of Seats for individuals. It is forbidden to book a Seat for transporting any object, package, animal traveling alone or material items whatsoever.<br/>
                <br/>
                Furthermore, it is prohibited to publish an Advert for a Driver other than you.<br/>
                <br/>
                4.3. Review system<br/>
                <br/>
                4.3.1. Operation<br/>
                <br/>
                Taggcar encourages you to leave a review about a Driver (if you are a Passenger) or about a Passenger (if you are a Driver) with whom you have shared a Trip or with whom you were supposed to share a Trip. However, you are not permitted to leave a review about another Passenger if you were a Passenger, or about a Member with whom you have not travelled or with whom you were not supposes to travel.<br/>
                <br/>
                Your review, and the review left by another Member about you, if any,, are only visible and published on the Platform after the shorter of the following periods: (i) immediately after you have both left a review, or (ii) after a period of 14 days following the first review.<br/>
                <br/>
                You have the option of responding to a review that another Member has left on your profile in a 14-day delay following the date of the review received. The review and your response, where applicable, will be published on your profile.<br/>
                <br/>
                4.3.2. Moderation<br/>
                <br/>
                You recognize and accept that Taggcar reserves the right not to publish or to delete any review, any question, any comment or any response if it deems its content breaches these T&Cs.<br/>
                <br/>
                4.3.3. Limit<br/>
                <br/>
                Taggcar reserves the right to suspend your Account, limit your access to the Services, or terminate these T&Cs in the case where (i) you have received at least three reviews and (ii) the average review you have received is less than or equal to 3.<br/>
                <br/>
                5. Financial conditions<br/>
                <br/>
                Access to and registration on the Platform, as well as searching, viewing and posting Adverts, are free of charge. However, the Booking is charged under the conditions described below.<br/>
                <br/>
                5.1. Cost Contribution<br/>
                <br/>
                The Cost Contribution is determined by you, as Driver, under your sole responsibility. You agree to limit the Cost Contribution you ask your Passengers to pay to the costs you actually incur to make the Trip. Otherwise, you alone will bear the risks of recharacterization of the transaction completed via the Platform.<br/>
                <br/>
                5.2. Service Fees<br/>
                <br/>
                In the context of Trips with Booking, Taggcar, in exchange for use of the Platform, at the time of Booking, shall collect service fees (hereinafter referred to as the “Service Fees”) calculated on the basis of the Cost Contribution. The service fee will range between 10 and 20 percent of each cost contribution to the driver.<br/>
                <br/>
                The Service Fees are collected by Taggcar for each Seat subject of a Booking by a Passenger.<br/>
                <br/>
                In the case of cross-border journeys, please note that the methods of calculation of the amount of the Service Fees and the applicable VAT vary according to the residence of the Passenger.<br/>
                <br/>
                5.3.    Rounding<br/>
                <br/>
                You recognize and accept that Taggcar may, at its full discretion, round up or down the Service Fees and the Cost Contribution.<br/>
                <br/>
                5.4.    Methods of payment and repayment of the Cost Contribution to the Driver<br/>
                <br/>
                5.4.1.    Collection mandate<br/>
                <br/>
                In using the Platform as Driver for Trips with Booking, you confer on Taggcar a collection mandate for the Cost Contribution in your name and on your behalf.<br/>
                <br/>
                Consequently, in the context of a Trip with Booking, and after manual or automatic acceptance of the Booking, Taggcar shall collect the whole of the sum paid by the Passenger (Service Fees and Cost Contribution).<br/>
                <br/>
                The Cost Contributions received by Taggcar are deposited in an account dedicated to payment of the Drivers.<br/>
                <br/>
                You recognize and accept that none of the sums received by Taggcar in the name and on behalf of the Driver gives entitlement to interest. You agree to respond diligently to any request of Taggcar, and more generally of any administrative or court authority competent particularly in the prevention or combating of money laundering. Notably, you agree to provide, on simple request, any useful evidence of address and/or identity.<br/>
                <br/>
                In the absence of response to these requests, Taggcar may take any measure it deems appropriate, notably freezing of the sums paid and/or suspension of your Account and/or termination of these T&Cs.<br/>
                <br/>
                5.4.2. Payment of the Cost Contribution to the Driver<br/>
                <br/>
                After the Trip, the Passengers shall have a period of 24 hours after the end of the Trip to submit a claim on the Trip to Taggcar. In the absence of claim of the Passengers within this period, Taggcar shall consider the Trip confirmed.<br/>
                <br/>
                From the time of this express or tacit confirmation, you shall have, as Driver, a credit payable on your Account. This credit corresponds to the total amount paid by the Passenger at the time of confirmation of the Booking reduced by the Service Fees, i.e. the Cost Contribution paid by the Passenger.<br/>
                <br/>
                When the Trip is confirmed by the Passenger, you have the option, as a Driver, of giving instructions to Taggcar to pay the money to your bank account (by entering your bank details in advance in your Account) or your PayPal account (by entering your PayPal email address in advance in your Account).<br/>
                <br/>
                The payment order in your name will be sent on the first working day after your request or, if you do not so request, the first working day after the provision of the sums in question to your profile (providing Taggcar has your bank information).<br/>
                <br/>
                At the end of the applicable time limitation periods, any sum not claimed from Taggcar shall be deemed to belong to Taggcar.<br/>
                <br/>
                Taggcar will allow beta users to accept payments in the form of cash or other payment method. These payments will not incur the service fee. Upon implementation of the booking system cash and other forms of payment will be restricted. <br/>
                <br/>
                6.    Non-commercial and non-business purpose of the Services and the Platform<br/>
                <br/>
                You agree to use the Services and the Platform only to be put into contact, on a non-business and non-commercial basis, with people wishing to share a Trip with you.<br/>
                <br/>
                As Driver, you agree not to request a Cost Contribution higher than the costs you actually incur and that may generate a profit, being specified that in the context of a cost sharing, you have to bear as a Driver your own part of the costs induced by the Trip. You are solely responsible for calculating the costs you incur for the Trip and for checking that the amount requested of your Passengers does not exceed the costs you actually incur (excluding your share of the costs).<br/>
                <br/>
                Taggcar reserves the right to suspend your Account in the case where you use a chauffeur-driven or other business vehicle or taxi, or a company car, and due to this, generate a profit from the Platform. You agree to provide to Taggcar, on its simple request, a copy of your car registration certificate and/or any other document showing that you are authorized to use this vehicle on the Platform and are not drawing any profit therefrom.<br/>
                <br/>
                Taggcar also reserves the right to suspend your Account, limit your access to the Services, or terminate these T&Cs, in the case of activity by you on the Platform which, owing to the nature of the Trips offered, their frequency, the number of Passengers carried and the Cost Contribution requested, entails a situation of profit for you, or for any reason suggesting to Taggcar that you are generating a profit on the Platform.<br/>
                <br/>
                7.    Cancellation policy<br/>
                <br/>
                7.1.    Terms of repayment in the case of cancellation<br/>
                <br/>
                Only Trips with Booking are the subject of this cancellation policy; Taggcar does not offer any guarantee, of any nature, in the case of cancellation for any reason, by a Passenger or a Driver, of a Trip without Booking.<br/>
                <br/>
                The cancellation of a Seat on a Trip with Booking by the Driver or the Passenger after Booking Confirmation is subject to the stipulations hereunder:<br/>
                <br/>
                –    In the case of cancellation owing to the Driver, the Passenger is refunded the whole of the sum paid (i.e. the Cost Contribution and the related Service Fees). This is notably the case when Driver cancels a Trip or has not arrived at the meeting point 15 minutes after the agreed time;<br/>
                <br/>
                –    In the case of cancellation owing to the Passenger:<br/>
                <br/>
                • If the Passenger cancels more than 24 hours before the planned departure time as mentioned in the Advert, the Passenger shall only be refunded the Cost Contribution. The Service Fees are retained by Taggcar and the Driver does not receive any sum of any nature;
                <br/>
                • If the Passenger cancels 24 hours or less before the planned departure time as mentioned in the Advert, and more than thirty minutes after the Booking Confirmation, the Passenger shall be refunded half the Cost Contribution paid at the time of Booking, the Service Fees are retained by Taggcar, and the Driver receives 50% of the Cost Contribution;
                <br/>
                • If the Passenger cancels 24 hours or less before the planned departure time, as mentioned in the Advert, and thirty minutes or less after the Booking Confirmation, the Passenger is refunded the whole of the Cost Contribution. The Service Fees are retained by Taggcar and the Driver does not receive any sum of any nature;
                <br/>
                • If the Passenger cancels after the planned departure time as mentioned in the Advert, or if he has not arrived at the meeting place 15 minutes after the agreed time, no refund shall be issued. The Driver shall be compensated with the whole of the Cost Contribution and the Service Fees are kept by Taggcar.<br/>
                <br/>
                When cancellation occurs before departure and owing to the Passenger, the Seat(s) cancelled by the Passenger shall be automatically made available to other Passengers, who may book them online and they are accordingly subject to the conditions of these T&Cs.<br/>
                Taggcar appreciates, in its sole discretion, on the basis of the available information, the legitimacy of the reimbursement requests.<br/>
                <br/>
                This is subject to the implementation of the booking system.<br/>
                <br/>
                7.2.    Right of withdrawal<br/>
                <br/>
                You have no right of withdrawal from the time of Booking Confirmation provided the Contract between you and Taggcar consisting of putting you in contact with another Member has been fully executed.<br/>
                <br/>

                <br/>
                11.2.    Content posted by you on the Platform<br/>
                <br/>
                In order to enable the provision of the Services, and in compliance with the purpose of the Platform, you grant Taggcar a non-exclusive license to use the content and data you provide in the context of your use of the Services (hereinafter referred to as your “Member Content”). In order to enable Taggcar to distribute via the digital network and in accordance with any communication protocol (notably internet and mobile network), and to provide the content of the Platform to the public, you authorize Taggcar, for the whole world and throughout the duration of your contractual relations with Taggcar, to reproduce, represent, adapt and translate your Member Content as follows:<br/>
                <br/>
                (i) you authorize Taggcar to reproduce all or part of your Member Content on any digital recording media, known or as yet unknown, and notably on any server, hard disk, memory card, or any other equivalent media, in any format and by any process, known or as yet unknown, to the extent necessary to any operation of storage, backup, transmission or download linked to the operation of the Platform and the provision of the Service;<br/>
                <br/>
                (ii) you authorize Taggcar to adapt and translate your Member Content, and to reproduce these adaptations on any digital media, current or future, stipulated in point (i) above, with the aim of providing the Services, notably in different languages.

                <br/>
                12.    Role of Taggcar<br/>
                <br/>
                The Platform constitutes an online networking platform on which the Members can create and post Adverts for Trips for the purposes of carpooling. These Adverts can notably be viewed by the other Members to find out the terms of the Trip, and where applicable, to directly book a Seat in the vehicle in question with the Member having posted the Advert on the Platform.<br/>
                <br/>
                In using the Platform and in accepting these T&Cs, you recognise that Taggcar is not party to any agreement entered into between you and the other Members with a view to sharing the costs relating to a Trip.<br/>
                <br/>
                Taggcar has no control over the behavior of its Members and the users of the Platform. It does not own, exploit, supply or manage the vehicles subject of the Adverts, and it does not offer any Trips on the Platform.<br/>
                <br/>
                You recognize and accept that Taggcar does not control the validity, truthfulness or legality of the Adverts, Seats and Trips offered. In its capacity of carpooling intermediary, Taggcar does not provide any transport service and does not act in the capacity of carrier; the role of Taggcar is limited to facilitating access to the Platform.<br/>
                <br/>
                The Members (Drivers or Passengers) act under their sole and full responsibility.<br/>
                <br/>
                In its capacity of intermediary, Taggcar cannot be held liable for the effective occurrence of a Trip, and notably owing to:<br/>
                <br/>
                (i) erroneous information communicated by the Driver in his Advert, or by any other means, with regard to the Trip and its terms;<br/>
                <br/>
                (ii) cancellation or modification of a Trip by a Member;<br/>
                <br/>
                (iii) non-payment of the Cost Contribution by a Passenger in the context of a Trip without Booking;<br/>
                <br/>
                (iv) the behavior of its Members during, before or after the Trip.<br/>
                <br/>
                13.    Operation, availability and functionalities of the Platform<br/>
                <br/>
                Taggcar shall try as far as possible to maintain the Platform accessible 7 days a week and 24 hours a day. Nevertheless, access to the Platform may be temporarily suspended, without notice, owing to technical maintenance, migration or update operations, or owing to outages or constraints linked to the operation of the network.<br/>
                <br/>
                Furthermore, Taggcar reserves the right to modify or suspend all or part of access to the Platform or its functionalities, at its sole discretion, temporarily or permanently.<br/>
